# Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App

## Project Description
This project involves predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the breast cancer dataset. The interactive web app built using **Streamlit** allows users to enter features of a tumor and get predictions.

The model is trained on the **UCI Breast Cancer Dataset** and uses **MLPClassifier** (Multilayer Perceptron) from **scikit-learn**.

## Access the Notebook:
You can view the complete Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training here: [Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App.ipynb](https://github.com/AngelReyes92/Assignment_4_ANN/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Streamlit%20App.ipynb)
